  * vulnerability: fix elements of group of material technologies
    ('mat_tech_grp') are wrongly assigned
  * vulnerability: add constraint to limit to the same distribution type
    for fragility functions
  * vulnerability: replace limit states lowercased names with themselves where
    all [^a-z0-9] chars are substituted with '_' and contiguous '_' are
    collapsed into one
