  * vulnerability: add constraint to limit to the same distribution type
    for fragility functions

  * vulnerability: replace limit states lowercased names with themselves where
    all [^a-z0-9] chars are substituted with '_' and contiguous '_' are
    collapsed into one

  [Ben Wyss]
  * Revers the x / y axis of the fragility discrete tables.

  * Add intensity measure as a column for the fragility discrete tables.

  * Add intensity measure as a column for the vulnerability discrete tables.

  * Vulnerability discrete table header is generated dynamically when the user selects an IML from a provided selection menu.

  * If the selected IML for a discrete vulnerability function is "SA" then the user is prompted to provide a value for the SA period before the table is generated.
