Welcome to Integrated Risk Viewer's documentation!
==================================================

The `Integrated Risk Viewer (IRV) <https://platform.openquake.org/irv/>`_ is an interactive web mapping and data
visualization tool developed by the `GEM Foundation <http://www.globalquakemodel.org/>`_ and designed jointly by the
GEM Foundation and the `Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction
Technology (CEDIM) <https://www.cedim.de/english/index.php>`_ for the exploration and communication of earthquake risk
using indicators. Within the application, users can load a project that has
been created using the `GEM Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/svir/>`_, which is a QGIS
plugin developed to allow users to form an integrated workflow to construct
metrics of characteristics of populations that create the potential for harm or
loss (e.g. social vulnerability indicators) and to integrate these with
measures of physical risk (i.e. estimations of human or economic loss) from the
`OpenQuake Engine <https://github.com/gem/oq-engine>`_, or other sources, to form what we refer to as an integrated risk
assessment. The Integrated Risk Viewer is intended to facilitate participatory
interaction and discussion of integrated risk primarily because it permits
users to: 1) visualize earthquake risk for respective places via the web, 2)
explore physical and social characteristics and components contributing to risk
using interactive visualization tools, and 3) modify weights of the input
factors of risk assessments which, in turn, directly affect the maps and
visualized values.
