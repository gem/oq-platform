Loading a project
=================

Access the available project layers by clicking on the "Load Project". From the
available layers, make a selection and then add the selected layer by clicking
"Load Selection". Once the selection is loaded, the user may pan, zoom, explore
the map visualizations, explore the data using parallel coordinated plots, and
manipulate indicator weights to explore alternate visualizations.

Once an indicator's weight has been modified, the charts and the thematic map
will be adjusted to the new values automatically. Please note that if the
indicator has an operator that ignores the weight as defined during its
construction within the Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit, then the map and
charts will remain unchanged.
