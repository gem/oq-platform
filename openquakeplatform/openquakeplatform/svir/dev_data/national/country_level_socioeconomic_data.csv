As a result, for instance, Polity IV does not differentiate between a monarchy and a single -party regime.

The Fragility Matrix scores each country on both Effectiveness and Legitimacy in four performance dimensions: Security, Political, Economic, and Social, at the end of the year 2011. Each of the Matrix indicators is rated on a four -point fragility scale: 0 “no frag
ility,” 1“low fragility,” 2 “medium fragility,” and 3 “high fragility"" with the exception of the Economic Effectiveness indicator, which is rated on a five point fragility scale (including 4 “extreme fragility”). The State Fragility Index, then, combines scores on the eight indicators and ranges from 0 “no fragility” to 25 “extreme fragility.” A country’s fragility is closely associated with its state capacity to mage conflict; make and implement public policy; and deliver essential services and its systemic resilience in maintaining system coherence, cohesion, and quality of life; responding effectively to challenges and crises, and sustaining progressive development.

"ENVDIPDFT","Environment","Disaster Prevalence","Droughts, floods, extreme temperatures","Percent","Annual average percentage of the population that is affected by natural disasters classified as either droughts, floods, or extreme temperature events.  A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.  A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.","EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database: www.emdat.be, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium), World Bank.","environment, land use, risk",2009,2009,0,"Annual","Sum","PCA Low",1.059,5.270,0.039,,1.012,,0.167,0.478,3.047,0.038,1.106,,,4.585,,0.022,0.002,0.806,0.858,0.014,1.297,0.493,0.740,0.482,,0.009,1.250,2.377,6.644,0.072,0.011,0.010,0.182,2.715,0.260,7.951,0.657,0.022,0.701,0.002,0.727,0.003,0.156,0.001,0.018,0.000,6.797,,0.079,0.025,0.336,0.012,0.361,,7.323,0.000,3.263,1.729,0.000,0.006,,0.197,0.770,0.033,0.974,0.007,,1.307,0.180,0.541,7.171,0.840,1.255,0.088,,4.356,0.161,3.057,0.015,0.005,0.001,0.007,1.143,0.021,0.369,0.217,6.478,5.003,,0.001,2.065,2.693,0.000,0.023,3.403,1.872,0.000,,0.000,0.000,0.305,0.865,8.820,0.097,0.031,0.653,,0.058,3.082,0.000,0.150,1.350,0.344,,2.561,0.012,0.076,3.662,0.092,3.401,,0.704,0.005,0.011,0.834,7.525,0.055,2.497,0.007,,1.055,,,0.196,0.731,0.715,1.952,0.806,0.032,0.002,,0.263,0.085,0.133,1.296,,,0.009,0.000,,,0.006,0.598,0.011,0.078,0.247,,0.045,0.000,0.090,4.604,1.806,0.080,0.729,2.160,2.765,0.340,9.227,0.000,0.004,0.508,,5.378,1.496,3.751,0.508,,0.001,0.098,0.137,0.000,,0.851,0.269,,0.032,0.214,0.265,0.124,0.106,,0.155,1.599,,0.099,4.200,,84%,100%,46%,100%,100%,94%,83%,100%,100%,60%,67%,86%,100%,90%,33%,100%,82%,100%,100%,69%,100%,72%,78%,"Percent of population affected, average 1990-2009"

Moreover, they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries. Child mortality rates are higher for boys than for girls in countries in which parental gender preferences are insignificant. Child mortality captures the effect of gender discrimination better than infant mortality does, as malnutrition and medical interventions are more important in this age group. Where female child mortality is higher, as in some countries in South Asia, girls probably have unequal access to resources. Child mortality rates in the table are not compatible with infant mortality and under-five mortality rates because of differences in methodology and reference year. Child mortality data were estimated directly from surveys and cover the 10 years preceding the survey

Social Watch computes a value for the gender gap in each of the three areas in a scale from 0 (when for example no women is educated at all and all men are) to 100 (perfect equality). The GEI, in turn, is the simple average of the three dimensions. In Education, GEI looks at the gender gap in enrolment at all levels and in literacy; economic participation computes the gaps in income and employment and empowerment measures the gaps in highly qualified jobs, parliament and senior executive positions.","SocialWatch","gender, population, equity",2008,2008,0,"Unknown","Unknown","No PCA possible",,56.000,52.000,,53.000,,72.000,,76.000,73.000,62.000,80.000,46.000,51.000,77.000,66.000,73.000,64.000,41.000,,66.000,,66.000,69.000,63.000,74.000,52.000,62.000,60.000,49.000,76.000,51.000,42.000,41.000,62.000,69.000,75.000,,68.000,37.000,74.000,70.000,69.000,69.000,,80.000,46.000,,66.000,55.000,71.000,40.000,67.000,45.000,45.000,74.000,52.000,,85.000,73.000,53.000,49.000,64.000,80.000,58.000,66.000,,49.000,51.000,48.000,61.000,,69.000,71.000,78.000,40.000,52.000,54.000,,70.000,73.000,65.000,61.000,61.000,47.000,75.000,59.000,,,,71.000,,76.000,47.000,64.000,,,,77.000,61.000,68.000,61.000,48.000,58.000,62.000,50.000,59.000,,49.000,60.000,60.000,,74.000,,70.000,,43.000,64.000,,71.000,,44.000,78.000,78.000,52.000,47.000,43.000,,84.000,48.000,42.000,,46.000,71.000,,67.000,69.000,76.000,71.000,72.000,50.000,43.000,72.000,76.000,80.000,,71.000,61.000,50.000,,47.000,47.000,55.000,,,41.000,66.000,74.000,71.000,,,70.000,54.000,77.000,53.000,41.000,56.000,50.000,89.000,63.000,51.000,,52.000,58.000,70.000,39.000,,70.000,49.000,46.000,,,64.000,74.000,51.000,75.000,75.000,75.000,57.000,56.000,,68.000,71.000,,29.000,55.000,57.000,79%,100%,62%,100%,80%,82%,67%,100%,25%,0%,89%,71%,100%,100%,33%,100%,82%,100%,78%,56%,94%,83%,78%,"None"

"ECOTREEVI","Economy","Trade Economics","Export volume index","Raw value","Export volume indexes are derived from UNCTAD's volume index series and are the ratio of the export value indexes to the corresponding unit value indexes. Unit value indexes are based on data reported by countries that demonstrate consistency under UNCTAD quality controls, supplemented by UNCTAD’s estimates using the previous year’s trade values at the Standard International Trade Classification three-digit level as weights. To improve data coverage, especially for the latest periods, UNCTAD constructs a set of average prices indexes at the three-digit product classification of the Standard International Trade Classification revision 3 using UNCTAD’s Commodity Price Statistics, interna­tional and national sources, and UNCTAD secretariat estimates and calculates unit value indexes at the country level using the current year’s trade values as weights. For economies for which UNCTAD does not publish data, the export volume indexes (lines 72) in the IMF's International Financial Statistics are used.","United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Handbook of Statistics and data files, and International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics.","private sector, trade, trade index",2007,2010,3,"Annual","Unknown","No PCA possible",121.483,406.130,97.811,86.224,226.725,30.401,173.971,172.658,128.614,167.460,595.482,79.173,102.153,264.622,78.647,176.692,126.330,79.274,175.307,273.919,218.939,275.083,130.407,185.730,88.707,222.814,326.629,85.064,324.965,77.315,87.217,255.920,61.200,683.375,144.832,562.381,169.725,76.814,172.476,169.054,101.962,96.592,247.742,89.330,301.050,120.593,143.351,37.808,91.921,,202.076,214.057,132.189,328.763,43.524,119.870,260.719,61.998,122.635,114.666,115.928,57.552,221.912,160.439,162.973,91.773,34.860,229.011,119.539,119.607,77.457,139.867,156.631,248.685,163.731,281.108,108.983,130.924,91.650,119.565,131.479,96.794,80.177,153.974,178.406,217.433,179.043,279.380,,128.291,167.437,278.657,240.213,417.022,342.521,25.605,133.540,,335.063,166.677,148.066,102.539,200.578,157.128,119.468,137.632,98.014,130.594,267.089,141.792,132.980,118.663,355.226,,144.623,,105.514,334.116,272.964,172.465,,65.595,160.370,133.046,241.937,156.761,118.642,281.054,99.997,112.725,171.990,69.726,,83.781,95.755,410.653,189.524,145.152,222.057,148.818,245.345,120.012,312.940,143.543,156.522,145.669,197.805,45.388,320.867,,103.215,90.706,125.519,,150.068,1737.599,235.734,413.150,247.785,193.749,119.624,115.405,288.388,137.125,115.633,208.197,228.460,88.950,125.783,185.720,127.712,,77.935,234.022,187.367,170.520,62.334,95.613,180.413,259.514,86.923,,268.829,166.171,163.786,104.528,132.701,195.081,186.501,122.669,,70.502,284.853,,77.048,262.440,60.194,93%,100%,100%,100%,100%,100%,83%,100%,100%,80%,100%,86%,100%,100%,67%,100%,91%,100%,100%,69%,100%,94%,78%,"None"

"ECOERECNT","Economy","Economic Resources","Net taxes on products","Net","Net taxes on products (net indirect taxes) are the sum of product taxes less subsidies. Product taxes are those taxes payable by producers that relate to the production, sale, purchase or use of the goods and services.

"ECOIDPGIN","Economy","Income Distribution and Poverty","GINI index","Raw value","GINI index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The GINI index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a GINI index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.","World Bank, Development Research Group.
