<p class="western">It is possible to identify different lateral load-resisting systems in two principal directions of the building by using the Direction attribute. In some buildings, there is more than one  lateral load-resisting system in each principal direction, or the system varies up the height of the building, in which case the Hybrid Lateral Load-Resisting System attribute is used.</p>
