 ====

  * Operative System: GNU-Linux Ubuntu 12.04 (codename: Precise Pangolin)
  * a user account within 'admin' group
  * the 'git' package installed on the machine
  * an internet connection
  * an IP address or a public FQDN that will be use to address the machine from
    the extern (we will call it <SITE_HOST>).

==== Installation ====

  * open a terminal as normal user
  * create a directory where download all repositories, for example: "geonode_stuff".
      $ mkdir geonode_stuff
  [ if you have private data csv file for instrumental catalog then create a directory
    named 'private_data' into your 'geonode_stuff' directory and copy it as 'isc_data.csv' file ]
  [ if you have a previous installation and you want migrate users to the new installation
    you need to run on the previous installation as root:
    $ sudo <oq-platform_repo>//oq-ui-api/bin/export-users.sh >users_data.json
    and copy the 'users_data.json' file to your new machine into your 'geonode_stuff/private_data' directory. ]
  * clone the oq-platform repository and move into the new repository with commands:
      $ git clone git://github.com/gem/oq-platform.git
      $ cd oq-platform
  * checkout the required version of the script with the command
      $ git checkout <version_name>
    where <version_name> is the version that you want to install
  * copy the oq-ui-api/bin/oq-platform-install.sh file into the previous created 'stuff' dir:
      $ cp oq-ui-api/bin/oq-platform-install.sh ../geonode_stuff
  * go into 'stuff' directory and run the installation script:
      $ cd ../geonode_stuff
      $ ./oq-platform-install.sh
    NOTE: to run some parts the script require root access so it will ask your
    password to 
  * the script will ask you:
    + "Public site url or public IP address ..."; you must
      answer with the public name of the machine (see above) <SITE_HOST>
    + username for django administrator
    + password for django administrator
    + email for django administrator
  * after the installation you can browse to "http://<SITE_HOST>" url to see 
    the local geonode homepage, to "http://<SITE_HOST>/geoserver" to see local geoserver
    homepage.

  **NOTE** the script will takes few minutes to finish, if you continuously see
  new lines of log on the display you can fill safe.

==== Enhance security with HTTPS protocol ====

After the installation you can increase your security using https instead of http protocol.

We provide a simple script to perform this task (and return to http, if required).

=== Requirements ===

  * a folder named 'private_data'
  * an ssl Certification Authority certificate 'oq-platform_CA.pem' into the 'private_data' folder
  * an ssl key named 'oq-platform.key' into the 'private_data' folder
  * an ssl certificate named 'oq-platform.crt' signed with te CA cert into the 'private_data' folder

  NOTE: into your common name (CN) or into an "alternative name" must appear your machine name.

=== Howto ===

  * cd into the parent directory of 'private-data'
  * run sudo <oq-platform directory>/oq-ui-api/bin/oq-platform2https.sh http2https

=== Revert ===

To return to the previous http protocol:

  * run sudo <oq-platform directory>/oq-ui-api/bin/oq-platform2https.sh revert
